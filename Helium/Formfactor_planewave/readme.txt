The form factor for a single electron ionised from the given configuration.
For the rates, you must multiply by the occupancy number.
eg for 2s, you should multiply for 2.

Form factors span the range q = 1 to 2000 keV and E = 1 eV to 2 keV. 
q is the momentum transfer [in keV] and E is the electron kinetic energy [in keV].
Data is optimised for q = 1 to 500 keV and E = 1 eV to 1 keV. 
Interpolation outside this range is not accurate.
Outgoing electron wave functions are plane waves.
The rates will be very inaccurate unless you correct with the Fermi Function.
Even with the Fermi Function, the rates will be less accurate compared to the form factors that use solutions of the Schroedinger equation.
