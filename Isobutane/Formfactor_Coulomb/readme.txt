The form factor for a single electron ionised from the given configuration.
For the rates, you must multiply by the occupancy number (this is given in the table in appendix of the paper).

Outgoing electron wave functions are Coulomb waves. Form factors span the a reduced range compared to the other files, owing to the numerical challenge calculating with a Coulomb wave.

The Coulomb wave form factors span the range E = 1 eV to 109.648 eV and energies given in the mathematica files.
 These results are given by the functions fC4H106a, etc.

At high q, we have also provided tables/functions that use a rescaled Plane wave ie we match the plane wave onto the Coulomb terms at large q values, and use the rescaled Plane wave results above that value. These are accessed by the fC4H10CWPW6a, etc.

We have used the following Zeff values in our Coulomb wave calculation for methane
All outer valence (6a1, 5e, 1a2, 4e, 3e) have Zeff = 1
