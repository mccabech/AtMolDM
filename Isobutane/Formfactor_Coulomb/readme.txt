The form factor for a single electron ionised from the given configuration.
For the rates, you must multiply by the occupancy number (this is given in the table of the paper).

Outgoing electron wave functions are Coulomb waves. Form factors span a reduced range compared to the other files, owing to the numerical challenge calculating with a Coulomb wave (there is no spherical symmetry with molecular bound states that help to simplify the problem).

The Coulomb wave form factors span the range E = 1 eV to 109.648 eV and q values given in the Mathematica files (ranging from 22 keV to 67 keV). These results are given by the functions fC4H106a, etc.

At higher q, we have also provided tables/functions where we have matched the plane wave onto the Coulomb results at large q values, and use the rescaled Plane wave results above that value. These are accessed by the fC4H10CWPW6a, etc.

We have used the following Zeff values in our Coulomb wave calculation for methane
All outer valence (6a1, 5e, 1a2, 4e, 3e, 5a1) have Zeff = 1.
All inner valence (4a1, 2e, 3a1) have Zeff = 2.7.
All core (2a1, 1e, 1a1) have Zeff = 4.7.
