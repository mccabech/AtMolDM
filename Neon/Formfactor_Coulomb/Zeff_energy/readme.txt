The form factor for a single electron ionised from the given configuration.
For the rates, you must multiply by the occupancy number.
eg for 2p, you should multiply for 6, for 2s, multiply by 2 etc.

Form factors span the range q = 1 to 2000 keV and E = 1 eV to 2 keV. 
q is the momentum transfer [in keV] and E is the electron kinetic energy [in keV].
Data is optimised for q = 1 to 500 keV and E = 1 eV to 1 keV. 
Interpolation outside this range is not accurate.
Outgoing electron wave functions are Coulomb waves.
The 2p rates have been obtained by summing over the m quantum number, which is equivalent to rotational averaging.

Zeff values used in our Coulomb wave calculation for xenon
Calculated from the ionisation energies with the formula I_n = 13.6 Z**2 / n**2.
